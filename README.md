So you chose to click on this commit, Im glad that you clicked on it, ktane players.

For those who found this README file commit hidden in the depths of this repository, here's a warning for everyone, especially Tas, Porcu and Makebao: If anyone decides to keep saying that my module is 'illegal to be posted becuase I didn't get concent', I will take all my modules down, and the blame is on whoever said that. The problem is clear enough, and no one is not involved.

“Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it's time for them to be hurt.”
